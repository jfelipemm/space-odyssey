## Space Odyssey

This project was made as part of the final credit for the course TAC 1 - Game Development in Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz.

### Credits

It was made using the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org) framework for Lua. The librarys [Classic](https://github.com/rxi/classic) and [Serpent](https://github.com/pkulchenko/serpent) were also used in the project.

Most of the image and audio assets that appear in the game can be found in [here](https://github.com/sparklinlabs/superpowers-asset-packs/).
